/**
 @public 
 A declarative sequence of CAAnimations.
 
 @discussion TimelineAnimation is a timed collection of CAPropertyAnimations.
 It permits you to declare in sequence the animations you want to perform in a 
 declarative way. It provides you with fine control over the start and 
 completion of the whole timeline, as well as the start and completion of each
 animation in a block oriented way.
 This way you can create complex animations and play, replay, or event change 
 the speed.
 
 You can create complex repeating animations, or animations based on 
 CADisplayLink.

 TimelineAnimation can notify you at a time during the animation other than its
 start or its comletion.

 You can also be notified based on the total progress of the timeline.

 TimelineAnimation permits you to associate audio to be played along with it.
